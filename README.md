# Functional
A library of utilities to enable functional programming in Java.

Provides Maybe, Either, and Result types to handle control flow as an alternative to exceptions.
Design of these types closely follows [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) types of the same name.

Provides functional interfaces for representing operations that may throw checked exceptions.

Provides combinators for combining and modifying functions.
